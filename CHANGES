Version 0.2.0:
* Added support for sending the same message to multiple recipients (implemented by sending
  that message multiple times at present.)  Normal #recipient method is present also, and
  does exactly the same thing as #recipients.  But you may enjoy the readability.
* Changed the API for initialising the message properties, is now more like Action Mailer's
  version (see the examples.)
* Improved README docs to describe what to import and where to find the config file.
* Updated bundled XMPP4R to the latest version.

Version 0.1.1:
* Fixed a glitch that caused mock mode to be permanently engaged while inside Rails.
* Fixed initialisation of the default messenger so that subclasses of ActionMessenger::Base
  don't have to declare uses_messenger.
