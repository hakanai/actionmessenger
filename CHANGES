Version 0.2.0:
* Added support for sending the same message to multiple recipients (implemented by sending
  that message multiple times.)
* Changed the API for initialising the message properties, is now more like Action Mailer's
  version (see the examples.)

Version 0.1.1:
* Fixed a glitch that caused mock mode to be permanently engaged while inside Rails.
* Fixed initialisation of the default messenger so that subclasses of ActionMessenger::Base
  don't have to declare uses_messenger.
