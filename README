= Action Messenger -- Instant Messaging made simple

Action Messenger is a framework for designing and testing application
components which both send and receive instant messages.  It was heavily
based on Action Mailer which does the same thing for email.

== Installation

Installation is as usual: either install from the gem or drop into the 'vendor'
directory of your Rails application.  Somewhere (probably in
'config/environment.rb') you will want to add the following:

 require 'action_messenger'

== Configuring the messenger

Configuration of messengers works in a similar fashion to configuration of
databases in Active Record.  The default location of the configuration file is
'config/messengers.yml'.

The simplest configuration is to use a single messenger.

 default:
   type: xmpp4r
   jid: user@example.com/resource
   password: secret

Multiple messengers can be defined in this fashion, however most applications
should only need one, and by default the messenger named 'default' is the one
which is used.

== Sending messages

The following is the simplest example of a class able to send a message:

  class AlarmClock < ActionMessenger::Base
    def wake_up(user)
      recipients user
      body       'Wake up!'
    end
  end

As with Action Mailer, sending or creating a message does not involve
calling your method directly:

  AlarmClock.create_wake_up("someone@example.com") # => Message object for unit tests
  AlarmClock.send_wake_up("someone@example.com")   # sends the message

== Receiving messages

To receive messages, implement a public instance method called receive that
takes an ActionMessenger::Message object as its single parameter.  They also
need to register to receive messages by calling receives_messages on the class.

A simple example:

  class MessageLogger < ActionMessenger::Base
    receives_messages

    def receive(message)
      MessageLogEntry.create(:sender => message.from
                             :body   => message.body)
    end
  end

== Dependencies

At present, the only dependency is XMPP4R, and this dependency is currently included in
this bundle.  XMPP4R is licenced under the Ruby licence; a copy of this licence can be
found in vendor/xmpp4r/LICENSE.

== License

Action Messenger is released under the MIT license.  A copy of this licence can be
found in the file named COPYING.

== Support

The homepage is currently at: http://trypticon.org/software/actionmessenger/

Contact details can be found at the homepage.

Action Messenger is currently extremely experimental software, and there is no
guarantee that it will be stable in the near future.  However, if people do find
bugs I will endeavour to fix them, and I am accepting feature requests that
aren't already listed on the homepage.
